# ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED - Fix Email Lookup Issue

## 🎯 Quick Fix (30 seconds)

Your forgot password page can't find users because it's looking in the wrong database table.

### ✅ Solution: Run This SQL Script

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your Trac-Q project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy & Paste This Code:**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_by_email(user_email TEXT)
   RETURNS TABLE (
     id UUID,
     email TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
   )
   LANGUAGE plpgsql
   SECURITY DEFINER
   SET search_path = public
   AS $$
   BEGIN
     RETURN QUERY
     SELECT 
       au.id,
       au.email,
       au.created_at
     FROM auth.users au
     WHERE au.email = user_email;
   END;
   $$;

   GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_by_email(TEXT) TO authenticated;
   GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_by_email(TEXT) TO anon;
   ```

4. **Click "Run"**

1. ✅ Accept email address only
2. ✅ Find your account in the database
3. ✅ Display your username (bipinrjl24)
4. ✅ Display masked email (bi****@gmail.com)
5. ✅ Send OTP to your email
6. ✅ Allow password reset
